MLT Release Notes
-----------------

Version 0.7.2 - May 1, 2011

This is a minor release to fix a few things between the 0.7.0 release

This is a major new release due to signficant additions to API, framework,

   transition.

Version 0.6.0 - January 1, 2011

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is 0.6.1.
There were quite a few enhancements and changes including a minor interface
change. Therefore, this release gets a jump in the versioning.

Framework
 * mlt_profile
   - Added (Y'CbCr) colorspace attribute.
   - Added mlt_profile_clone().
 * Added mlt_consumer_position() and Mlt::Consumer::position().
 * Added Mlt::Properties::wait_for(string).
 * Added a version API: mlt_version_get_int() and others.
 * Added Mlt::Producer::pause().
 * Added mlt_frame_write_ppm() for debugging.

Melt
 * Added automatic detection of profile from first input when profile
   not specified.
 * Now exits with error result when consumer fails fatally.

Modules
 * Added swfdec producer for Flash files including variables support.
   (Does not support audio.)
 * Added consumer for Blackmagic Design DeckLink SDI and Intensity HDMI.
 * Added Y'CbCr colorspace conversion and option to use full luma range.
 * Added (de)serialization of profile to XML.
 * Added support for #frame# variable to the data_show filter.
 * Added support for frei0r string parameters.
 * Make FFmpeg formats and codecs available as properties (not just stderr).
 * Try to load .xml file as MLT XML.
 * Added a consumer-sdl-paused event to sdl_preview.
 * Added a consumer-fatal-error event to avformat.
 * Change composite transition to default to progressive rendering; field-
   based rendering available only explicitly.


Version 0.5.10 - September 13, 2010

This is a quick followup to the 0.5.8 release to address an issue I want to
address immediately. I noticed an extra unconditional colorspace conversion
to and from RGB was added for all YCbCr (YUV) video sources. In addition, I
have enabled the avcolor_space filter on OS X since it works now.


Version 0.5.8 - September 12, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is 0.6.
This is a maintenance release to address some bugs that appeared
thus far in the 0.5.x series. Beyond that is a few enhancements:

* Added EXIF-based auto-rotation of images to pixbuf and qimage producers.
* Improved quality of libswscale-based image conversion and scaling.
* Added channelswap and panner audio filters; panner also does balance.
* Improve audio waveform and add audiowave video filter.
* Enhanced luma filter to work with animated filters such as affine.
* Automatically crop 8 bottom lines of 1088 source in a 16:9 project
  (common in Canon EOS digital cameras).
* Added support for inline images in kdenlivetitler.


Version 0.5.6 - June 20, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is 0.6.
This is a maintenance release to address some bugs that appeared
this far in the 0.5.x series. Beyond that it a few enhancements:

* Added interpolation to the affine transition and filter.
* Added multi-track audio encoding to avformat consumer.
* Added interlaced field rendering to kdenlivetitle producer.


Version 0.5.4 - April 19, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is another maintenance release to address some bugs that appeared
this far in the 0.5.x series. Beyond that it adds two things that only
very specific users will see:

* Added C# (ECMA CLR) binding (not enabled by default).
* Linsys SDI consumer now configures itself from MLT profile.


Version 0.5.2 - March 10, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is a minor maintenance release, but it is interesting because it now
enables usage of libswscale as the default choice for image scaling,
image format conversion, and color space conversion. That gives better
quality and performance. In addition, there are some improvements in the
sdl_preview consumer to make it suitable for use in OpenShot 1.1. Other
things:

* Fixed mlt++/MltFilteredProducer
* Fixed playing to the end in Kdenlive (mantis bug 1207)
* Fixed crash load uncompressed video
* Fixed compiling yadif for non-sse2 builds


Version 0.5.0 - February 15, 2010

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is an enhancement release, confined mainly to the modules rather than
the framework. In particular, this adds support for VDPAU, YADIF, and HD-SDI
technologies!

configure: added --disable-sse2

framework:

modules:
* avformat producer:
  - added decoding H.264 with NVIDIA VDPAU
    Requires FFmpeg built with vdpau.
    This is automatically detected and enabled. You can disable this by
	setting environment variable MLT_NO_VDPAU=1 or property novdpau=1.
  - added caching of FFmpeg contexts and decoded images
    This allows large numbers of clips in a project avoiding limitations
	with number of threads and file descriptors permitted per process.
